# Welcome to Project Anthropos!

This project is my attempt ot implement various machine learning algorithms (mostly artificial neural networks) from scratch. I am using libraries like numpy for efficiency, but no machine learning libraries. Why do I do that? Project Anthropos obviously is not faster that existing libraries, and there's already a lot of them. I ti it mostly to learn how the different types of ML algorithms work to a fundamental level, and to allow myself greater cusomizability for my personal ML projects.

# The Structure of Anthropos

[I will expaned opun this later, with a UML diagram, but currently I'm flexible]

Types of learning I want to support:

- Supervised learning

- Unsupervised learning

- Reinforcement learning

- Feature learning (I need to first read about it)

- Sparse dictionary learning (I need to first read about it)

- Anomaly detection (I need to first read about it)

- Association rule (I need to first read about it)

Types of NN I want to create:

- Feed-Foreword (basic) Neural Network

- Convolutional Neural Network

- Recurrent Neural Network

- Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (what's the difference between that and RNN?)

Additionally, Each NN will have a basic dataset and trained bot, that way I can debug and feel like I have accomplished something.

Interesting non-NN learning algorithms:

- Decision trees

- Support vector machines (I need to first read about it)

- Bayesian networks

- Genetic algorithms
